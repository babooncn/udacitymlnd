For deterministic approach, as a first choice Random forest is the best. Random Forest is considered to be the most popular and successful algorithm to be considered as a first choice.  With some tuning/boosting, Gradient Boosting is a good choice. Since the dataset tend to follow Normal distribution, I have selected Gaussian Bayes Classifier as the third one.\n",

    "-----------------\n",

    "Random Forests are a combination of tree predictors where each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The basic principle is that a group of “weak learners” can come together to form a “strong learner”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests are a wonderful tool for making predictions considering they do not overfit because of the law of large numbers. Introducing the right kind of randomness makes them accurate classifiers and regressors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applicability:\n",

    "Random forests can be used for classification or regression analysis. They are an ensemble of different trees and are used for classification or nonlinear multiple regression. Each leaf contains a distribution for the random/continuous output variable/s.\n",

    "•\tCan handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion.\n",

    "\n",
    "•\tRandom forests have been observed to overfit for some datasets with noisy classification/regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tFor data including categorical variables with different number of levels, random forests are biased in favor of those attributes with more levels. Therefore, the variable importance scores from random forest are not reliable for this type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tMost implementations of Random Forests are slow when you have a large number of features \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tRandom Forests aren't good at generalizing to cases with completely new data. For example, if I tell you that 1 chocolate costs $1, 2 chocolates cost $2, and 3 chocolates cost $3, how much do 10 chocolates cost? A linear regression can easily figure this out, while a Random Forest has no way of finding the answer.\n",

    "A common task that appears in different machine learning applications is to build a non-parametric regression or classification model from the data. When designing a model in domain-specific areas, one strategy is to build a model from theory and adjust its parameters based on the observed data. \n",

    "The main idea of boosting is to add new models to the ensemble sequentially. At each particular iteration, a new weak, base-learner model is trained with respect to the error of the whole ensemble learnt so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "In gradient boosting, the learning procedure consecutively fits new models to provide a more accurate estimate of the response variable. The principle idea behind this algorithm is to construct the new base-learners to be maximally correlated with the negative gradient of the loss function, associated with the whole ensemble. \n",
